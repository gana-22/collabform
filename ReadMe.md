# CollabForm: A Google Forms-like Platform

## Project Overview

This repository contains the system architecture design for CollabForm, a platform similar to Google Forms. The system provides an interface for users to create various types of forms (like surveys, quizzes, event registrations), distribute these to respondents via different channels, and collect and analyze responses.

**Note:** Throughout this documentation, I have used "document" as the primary terminology instead of "form" since forms are considered a subset of documents in our architecture approach.

### Key Requirements

- Standalone product, accessible via modern web browsers
- Capable of User Registration & Authentication, form creation & editing, form distribution, response collection & data analysis
- Support for real-time collaboration among multiple users
- Options to customize the look and feel of the documents
- Privacy and security of document data
- Scalability and reliability to support a growing user base (potentially millions of users)
- Support for various question types (multiple choice, short answer, rating scale, etc.)

## Technical Implementation Details: Real-time Collaboration

After analyzing both Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) and Operational Transformation (OT) approaches for real-time document collaboration, I've chosen to implement **CRDT-based collaboration** for the following reasons:

### Why CRDT Over OT

1. **Decentralized Nature**: CRDT is inherently designed for distributed systems and doesn't require a central server for conflict resolution, making it more resilient to network partitions.

2. **Eventual Consistency**: CRDT guarantees that all replicas will eventually converge to the same state without requiring strict ordering of operations.

3. **Reduced Complexity**: While OT requires complex transformation matrices for different operation types, CRDT's mathematical properties simplify the implementation and reasoning about concurrent edits.

4. **Better Offline Support**: CRDTs handle offline editing and synchronization more naturally, allowing users to continue working even when disconnected.

5. **Scalability Advantages**: CRDTs have better scaling properties for large numbers of concurrent users since they don't need to maintain a global order of operations.

6. **Reduced Server Load**: The conflict resolution in CRDTs happens primarily at the client level, reducing server processing requirements.

## System Architecture Breakdown

### Domain Model

The domain model describes the entities and entity relationships in the CollabForm system.

- [Entity Definitions and Attributes (PDF)](Q1%3A%20Domain%20Model/Domain%20Model.pdf) - Detailed descriptions of each entity

### Data Model and Data Storage

Discusses the document schema structure to support a wide variety of form and question types, and to enable efficient analysis of form responses. This section also covers data consistency approaches across the system.

### Business Rules and Constraints

Describes the rules and constraints that govern the behavior of entities, interactions, and processes within the domain.

## System Capabilities

The CollabForm platform provides:

- User registration with email verification
- Document creation and editing with multiple question types
- Document customization (title, description, themes, logo)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Multiple distribution channels (link sharing, email, embedding)
- Anonymous or identified response collection
- Real-time response collection and analysis
- Analytics functionality

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Handles high loads and millions of simultaneous users
- **Reliability**: Includes data backup and recovery measures
- **Security**: Protects user data and prevents unauthorized access

## Technology Stack

I've chosen a minimalist approach aligned with existing technology:

- **Frontend/Backend**: JavaScript, Node.js
- **Databases**:
  - MongoDB (document storage)
  - Redis (caching)
- **Message Queue/Broker**:
  - Apache Kafka
- **Collaboration Technology**: CRDT-based implementation

**PostgreSQL** introduced as a new technology following these principles:
- Solves new problems or improves existing solutions with lower resources
- Open source with free-to-use licensing
- Actively developed and maintained

## Implementation Considerations

While designing this system, particular attention was paid to:

1. **Data Consistency**: How to maintain consistency across distributed components
2. **Scalability**: Approaches to horizontal scaling for peak usage times
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Implementation of CRDT for conflict resolution
4. **Security**: Measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access
5. **High Availability**: Failover and redundancy strategies
